      <description>&lt;p&gt;I learnt about &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tinychallenges.com/&#34;&gt;Tiny Challenges&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; on a recent
episode of &lt;a href=&#34;http://iohyespodcast.com/&#34;&gt;iOHYes Podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept is simple, achieve big goals by breaking them down into smaller
ones, so small it would be impossible to fail. For example achieve the goal of
exercising more by challenging yourself to do 1 push-up a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My tiny challenge for January is to &lt;strong&gt;spend 1 minute a day reviewing my
expenses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something I have been meaning to do for a while but always failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there is a lot of value in being aware of were your money goes in
detail. It allows you to have a better understanding of your saving capability,
and therefore plan accordingly, and also can help discover patterns or find out
where to optimise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried different apps in the past, but for this round I will use a simple
Google Spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shall report next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be the change you want to see in the world. -Gandhi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello World</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is my birthday and this blog is my present to myself. I have other things
to do right now, but I decided to take some time to write this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past every blog I started with a declaration of intents post like this
one has always failed, but I think this time it will be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have decided to write in this web journal to share my &lt;em&gt;continuous improvement journey&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I am trying to say is that I want to share all the little lessons learned,
experiment, and retrospective of a journey with no destination but only one
goal, always improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I what I might write about is diet, habits, yoga sequences, exercises,
opinions on books I read, quotes from podcasts I listen. As time goes on I think
the content might change, as my journey moves onto different areas of focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure I will get a lot of value from this writing practice, both in the
form of future reference and thoughts consolidation and retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be the change you want to see in the world. -Gandhi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
