    <h1><a href="http://mokagio.github.io/continuous-improvement-journal/post/2016-01-05-morning-routine-januray-2016/">Morning Routine - January 2016</a></h1>
    <p>I will quickly describe the current version of my morning routine, and how it evolves, so that I&rsquo;ll be able to look back at it retrospectively. Also, you might like it and pick something from it, or you might think something is silly, and tell me about it. When I have control on my morning this is what I do: Wake up at 5:00am Smile Drink a big glass of water Open the door and get some fresh air in Do some relaxed stretching and circumvolutions Read a couple of pages of the current book I&rsquo;m reading Journal Work till more or less 6:20am, focusing on what I think is the most productive thing I can bo 1 to 3 rounds of sun salutations Make breakfast, oatmeal with nuts and blueberries Eat breakfast while reading an interesting article from my Pocket list By this time it is almost time to leave for work.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://mokagio.github.io/continuous-improvement-journal/post/2016-01-04-tiny-challenges-january-2016/">January 2016 Tiny Challenge: Money Tracking</a></h1>
    <p>I learnt about &ldquo;Tiny Challenges&rdquo; on a recent episode of iOHYes Podcast. The concept is simple, achieve big goals by breaking them down into smaller ones, so small it would be impossible to fail. For example achieve the goal of exercising more by challenging yourself to do 1 push-up a day. My tiny challenge for January is to spend 1 minute a day reviewing my expenses. This is something I have been meaning to do for a while but always failed.</p>
