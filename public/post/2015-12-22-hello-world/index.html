  <p>Today is my birthday and this blog is my present to myself. I have other things
to do right now, but I decided to take some time to write this.</p>

<p>In the past every blog I started with a declaration of intents post like this
one has always failed, but I think this time it will be different.</p>

<p>I have decided to write in this web journal to share my <em>continuous improvement journey</em>.</p>

<p>What I am trying to say is that I want to share all the little lessons learned,
experiment, and retrospective of a journey with no destination but only one
goal, always improving.</p>

<p>Right now I what I might write about is diet, habits, yoga sequences, exercises,
opinions on books I read, quotes from podcasts I listen. As time goes on I think
the content might change, as my journey moves onto different areas of focus.</p>

<p>I am sure I will get a lot of value from this writing practice, both in the
form of future reference and thoughts consolidation and retrospective.</p>
