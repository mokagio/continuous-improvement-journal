  <p>I will quickly describe the current version of my morning routine, and how it
evolves, so that I&rsquo;ll be able to look back at it retrospectively.</p>

<p>Also, you might like it and pick something from it, or you might think
something is silly, and <a href="https://twitter.com/mokagio">tell me about it</a>.</p>

<p>When I have control on my morning this is what I do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wake up at 5:00am</li>
<li>Smile</li>
<li>Drink a big glass of water</li>
<li>Open the door and get some fresh air in</li>
<li>Do some relaxed stretching and circumvolutions</li>
<li>Read a couple of pages of the current book I&rsquo;m reading</li>
<li>Journal</li>
<li>Work till more or less 6:20am, focusing on what I think is the most productive thing I can bo</li>
<li>1 to 3 rounds of <a href="http://yoga.about.com/od/yogasequences/ss/sunsalutesteps.htm#step1">sun salutations</a></li>
<li>Make breakfast, oatmeal with nuts and blueberries</li>
<li>Eat breakfast while reading an interesting article from my <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> list</li>
</ul>

<p>By this time it is almost time to leave for work. I am on client side in an
area of Melbourne full of office workers that I can reach only by tram, so in
order to avoid the peak hour &ldquo;<em>sardine box</em>&rdquo; experience I get in at around 8am
and leave at around 4pm.</p>

<p>During my commute I either write, like I&rsquo;m doing right now, read, listen to
podcasts, or manage my <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> board.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, in a month or two I expect to have a less strict time requirement to
leave for work in the morning, so I might tweak the schedule.</p>
