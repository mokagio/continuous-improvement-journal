  <p>I learnt about &ldquo;<a href="http://www.tinychallenges.com/">Tiny Challenges</a>&rdquo; on a recent
episode of <a href="http://iohyespodcast.com/">iOHYes Podcast</a>.</p>

<p>The concept is simple, achieve big goals by breaking them down into smaller
ones, so small it would be impossible to fail. For example achieve the goal of
exercising more by challenging yourself to do 1 push-up a day.</p>

<p>My tiny challenge for January is to <strong>spend 1 minute a day reviewing my
expenses</strong>.</p>

<p>This is something I have been meaning to do for a while but always failed.</p>

<p>I think there is a lot of value in being aware of were your money goes in
detail. It allows you to have a better understanding of your saving capability,
and therefore plan accordingly, and also can help discover patterns or find out
where to optimise.</p>

<p>I tried different apps in the past, but for this round I will use a simple
Google Spreadsheet.</p>

<p>I shall report next month.</p>
