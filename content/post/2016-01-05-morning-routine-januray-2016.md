title: Morning Routine - January 2016
---

I will quickly describe the current version of my morning routine, and how it
evolves, so that I'll be able to look back at it retrospectively.

Also, you might like it and pick something from it, or you might think
something is silly, and [tell me about it](https://twitter.com/mokagio).

When I have control on my morning this is what I do:

- Wake up at 5:00am
- Smile
- Drink a big glass of water
- Open the door and get some fresh air in
- Do some relaxed stretching and circumvolutions
- Read a couple of pages of the current book I'm reading
- Journal
- Work till more or less 6:20am, focusing on what I think is the most productive thing I can bo
- 1 to 3 rounds of [sun salutations](http://yoga.about.com/od/yogasequences/ss/sunsalutesteps.htm#step1)
- Make breakfast, oatmeal with nuts and blueberries
- Eat breakfast while reading an interesting article from my [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) list

By this time it is almost time to leave for work. I am on client side in an
area of Melbourne full of office workers that I can reach only by tram, so in
order to avoid the peak hour "_sardine box_" experience I get in at around 8am
and leave at around 4pm.

During my commute I either write, like I'm doing right now, read, listen to
podcasts, or manage my [Trello](https://trello.com/) board.

That's it, in a month or two I expect to have a less strict time requirement to
leave for work in the morning, so I might tweak the schedule.
