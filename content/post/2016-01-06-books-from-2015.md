title: Books I've read in 2015

Before starting the new year I'd like to share the books I read during 2016,
and something they thought me.

I love reading, I always had. I'm one of those guys that always say "the book
was better than the movie", because that's just how it is!

During this year I developed a passion for non-fiction books, which I never
really had before.

Of [the 13 books I've read in 2016](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2015/13240343)
these are the one that thought me the most.

### [How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big](http://geni.us/xW0)

I couldn't have chosen a better book to read at the end of the year and charge
me up for an upcoming new one.

"How to fail at almost everything and still win big" by [Scott Adams](http://blog.dilbert.com/),
the author of [Dilbert](http://dilbert.com/), is a great little book full of
life lessons and tips, all delivered with a fun, entertaining, and a little
sarcastic style.

I really enjoyed this book and the content resonated with me deeply. I might
soon write a focused review of what I learnt from it, but here's the key
takeaways. Goals are for losers, systems are for winners. A system is a
continuous improvement strategy, any choice, any action you take is not toward
a goal, but towards always getting better, always gaining experience and
valuable skills. The most important system to put in place is the one to
improve your happiness. To achieve happiness, and unlocking success, you should
start by optimizing everything based one your energy, beginning with nutrition
and exercise. Finally, there is not way to remove luck from the success
equation, deal with it, but by working based using continuous improvement
systems rather than goals you can reduce luck's contribution.

### [So Good They Can't Ignore You](http://geni.us/1lul)

I discovered this book thanks to [Katrina Owen](https://twitter.com/kytrinyx)
and her talks about passion in the software industry.

The point the book tries to make is that "following your passion" might not be
the smartest choice when choosing a career. **Deliberate practice** of your
skills and **strategy in choosing what to learn** will make you succeed
instead.

I felt the book was a little biased, and the example showed were too extreme,
but still the message resonated with me a lot. After reading it I started
evaluating the choice of articles to read and things to research more
carefully.

Hopefully in 2016 I will be able to schedule a bit more time for deliberate
practice.

### [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://hpmor.com/)

Apart from being a brilliant fan fiction Harry Potter story, which I enjoyed
more that the original being a grown up now, this book is also sprinkled with
lessons on the rationality, the scientific method, critical thinking, and much
more.

Some parts have been eye openers and fired up an interest in rationality that I
knew I had but never really realised could be cultivated in such a way.

### [The Martian](http://geni.us/3fxT)

This novel hooked me up with all the scientific and engineering monologues the
protagonist goes through while applying his problem solving abilities to
survive alone on Mars against all odds.

If you are wondering, yes, I read it before the movie was out, and yes, the
book is better than the movie.

### [Maybe Haskell](https://gumroad.com/l/maybe-haskell)

This is a book I read in light of the _deliberate practice_ strategy taught me
by "So good they can't ignore you".

The books explores the `Maybe` type in the [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
programming language, which is a purely functional language that inspired
[Swift](https://swift.org/) one of my daily tools of trade.

Understanding this book required a bit of effort and definitely pushed me out
of my comfort zone, but it was very rewarding and laid the foundation for a
wider set of skills and understanding of functional programming that I hadn't
been able to get before.

### [The Fabric of the Cosmos](http://geni.us/f6L)

This book entertained me and showed me how reality is so much more complex than
I'd ever thought possible, and that _"truth is stranger than sci-fi"_.

There's not much more I can say about this book, most of the stuff I haven't
fully understood, and I would make a very bad and confusing job of explaining,
but it gave me hours and
